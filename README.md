# React COVID Tracker

This is a single-page React application that displays current deaths, infections, and recoveries in U.S and 191 other countries. Data are fetched in real-time from a [COVID-19 API](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api) and a [COVID Tracking API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api).

A simple voice assistant is also implemented using [Alan AI platform](https://alan.app/). The app is connected to Alan AI studio and can respond to the following voice commands:
1. "What does this app do?" or "What can I do here?"  -  Alan AI will explain what this app does for you.
2. "Show me the status of (country of your choice)."  -  Alan AI will then switch to show the status of your selected country. 

**Important Note: I only have about 2000 free interactions left so if they are used up it is possible voice control will not work.**
