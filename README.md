** COVID Tracker App **

This is a react application that displays current COVID-19 status of various countries. Data are fetched from https://covid19.mathdro.id/api and https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/us/daily.json APIs and are displayed using cards and either a line graph or a bar chart. 

I am currently adding voice control capability to the app. Right now, the app is connected to Alan AI studio and can respond to the following voice commands:
1. "What does this app do?" or "What can I do here?"  -  Alan AI will explain what this app does for you.
2. "Show me the status of (country of your choice)."  -  Alan AI will then switch to show the status of your selected country. 

**  Important Note: I only have about 2000 free interactions left so if they are used up it is possible voice control will not work.
